Here's how the game works!

1: Whenever someone comes to the page, it asks them for their name.

2: Once they input a name, Firebase checks to see how many players have already joined. If there aren't any or just one, it puts them in the database as the respective player. If there are already two players, it will notify that person and not let them join.

3: Once two people have joined, the game starts and player 1's box highlights and they may choose their item.

4: After player 1 choooses, their choice is hidden from player 2 and player 2's box highlights and they can make their choice.

5: Once both players have made their choices, both answers are shown to everyone and the winner is announced in the middle!

6: Finally, the round resets and the player stats are updated at the bottom of each box according to the result.

Bonus: This app also features a chat section at the bottom of the page where the players can taunt each other!
